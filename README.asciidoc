DMBuce's MTG Decks
==================

A collection of decks I've built for Magic: The Gathering.

Deck Construction
-----------------

For EDH in particular, I tend to construct my decks by grouping cards into
different "piles" or "categories". I find this helps me figure out which areas
I'm weakest in and which areas need cuts. Having too many piles in a deck is
usually a good indicator that I'm trying to do too many things and need to get
rid of a few subthemes. Here's a brief description of the piles I usually
include:

**???**::
	The first few piles in most of my decks are usually deck-specific and
	relate to what the deck tries to do. Some examples: My Dr. Roon deck has a
	Flicker pile, Rakdos has Pingers and Fatties piles, and a lot of
	my decks have Aggression and Defense piles.

**Card Advantage**::
	This might be better termed as "Gas" and includes cards that get me other
	cards from my library or graveyard into my hand or onto the battlefield.
	Sometimes I split this up into Draw, Recursion, Tutors, Wheel Effects,
	etc.

**Removal**::
	Cards that deal with problematic permanents. Usually counterspells get
	lumped in here, sometimes they get their own pile.

**Mana**::
	Mana rocks, mana dorks, cards like [[Mana Echoes]], etc.

**Land**::
	Basics and Nonbasics. Sometimes I lump this in with the Mana pile.

Deck Format
-----------

Decklists are in files with .deck extensions and formatted in MediaWiki
markup. Cards are surrounded by double brackets so that I can easily convert
to different markup formats using
