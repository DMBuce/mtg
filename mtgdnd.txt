Magic: the Subgame

Goal: Create a tabletop RPG using MTG cards. Rules should be simple and easy
to understand.

=== Rules ===

; Cube
The cube is a pool of cards provided by the GM that represent the spells that
mages and planeswalkers in the multiverse are capable of learning. In order
for players to gain access to new spells, the first thing they must do is
draft them from the cube.

; Draft
To "draft" a card, put it from the cube into your card pool.

; Card Pool
A player's card pool represents the spells he or she is capable of casting, as
well their bonds with different realms throughout the multiverse.
It consists of the cards he or she drafted, one of each basic
land (including Wastes), a cycle of Taplands, and cards acquired while
exploring the multiverse. Not all cards in a player's card pool may be
included in his or her deck; see "Deck Construction", below.

; Taplands
Each player starts the game with all five lands from one of the following
cycle of taplands in their card pool:

* White-bordered taplands from 8th Edition
* Black-bordered taplands from Invasion
* Snow taplands from Coldsnap
* Allied guildgates from Return to Ravnica / Gatecrash
* Enemy guildgates from Return to Ravnica / Gatecrash
* Taplands from Oath of the Gatewatch

The lands that a player starts the game with in this way gain the "Tapland"
subtype.

; Command Zone
A player can play lands they own from the command zone. If a player would
search his or her library for a land, he or she searches his or her library
and command zone for that land instead.

Each players starts the game with one Wastes in the command zone. Some skills
let you put lands from your card pool into the command zone.

; Deck Construction
In order for a player to be able to include a card in his or her deck, it must
share a color with that player's color profile, and the player must have the
Mastery skill corresponding to each of that card's types (not including
subtypes and supertypes).

=== Characters ===

You are a planeswalker, a powerful mage capable of traveling to other planes
in the multiverse. You have a number of statistics, or "stats", that define
your basic physical attributes and spellcasting abilities, as summarized and
described below.

*Note: In addition to the stats on this table, players also start with 10
lands in their card pool (5 basics and 5 taplands), and 10 skills of their
choice

; Color Profile (starting value: {C})

Your color profile represents the colors of mana your character is most
aligned with. You add colors to your color profile by taking the Personality
Growth skill.

In order for you to include a card in your deck, that card must share a color
with your color profile and you must have mastery over all its card types.

You gain mastery for different card types by taking the Spell Mastery and
Permanence Mastery skills.

In order for you to include a card in your deck, that card must share a color
with your color profile and you must have mastery over all its card types.

; Life

Your Life represents how much damage you can take, and determines your
starting life total. You increase your Life by taking the Improved Toughness
skill.

determines your starting hand size and maximum hand size. You increase your
Hand by taking the Improved Cleverness skill.
