Custom MTG DND format

Goal: Create a P&P RPG using MTG cards.

Rules should be simple and easy to understand.

=== Name ===

Magic: the Subgame

This game needs a name. Should be evocative of both Magic (or trading card
games) and DnD (or roleplaying games).

Some names that are already taken:

=== Design ===

There's lots of concepts from various MTG formats that can be useful.

Color identity from EDH/commander (or color profile from cube)

Perfect fixing from battlebox or whatever it's called

Small hand size from that three-card combo format

Might want to remove mill as a win condition

Flavor judging from flavor magic

3v1 a la archenemy
